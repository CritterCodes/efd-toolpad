# Quality Control System Implementation Summary

## üéØ Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive Quality Control workflow system that allows staff to:
- Review completed repairs before customer pickup
- Document quality with photos for liability protection
- Approve repairs for pickup or reject back to work
- Add detailed notes and quality ratings

## üìÅ System Architecture

### Core Files Created/Updated:

#### Constants & Configuration
- `quality-control/constants.js` - QC workflow definitions, photo config, validation rules

#### Custom Hooks
- `quality-control/hooks/useQualityControl.js` - Centralized state management for QC forms

#### Utility Functions
- `quality-control/utils/qcUtils.js` - Business logic for QC operations
- `quality-control/utils/RepairsService.js` - Client-side API wrapper for repair operations

#### UI Components
- `quality-control/components/QcPhotoUploader.js` - Photo upload with preview and validation
- `quality-control/components/QcDecisionForm.js` - Approve/reject workflow with notes
- `quality-control/components/QcRepairSummary.js` - Repair details display for QC review

#### Pages
- `quality-control/page.js` - Main QC dashboard showing all repairs pending review
- `quality-control/[repairID]/page.js` - Detailed QC review page for individual repairs

#### API Routes
- `api/repairs/[repairID]/route.js` - Individual repair CRUD operations
- `api/repairs/quality-control/route.js` - QC-specific operations with photo upload

## üîß Key Features

### Photo Documentation System
- Multiple photo upload with drag-and-drop
- Image validation (type, size, dimensions)
- Preview functionality with delete capability
- S3 integration for secure storage
- Liability protection documentation

### Quality Control Workflow
- **Approval Path**: repair ‚Üí ready_for_pickup (customer can collect)
- **Rejection Path**: repair ‚Üí ready_for_work (returns to production)
- Inspector assignment and quality ratings
- Issue categorization with severity levels
- Detailed notes and recommendations

### Form Validation & UX
- Real-time form validation
- Loading states during operations
- Error handling with user feedback
- Responsive design for all devices
- Consistent Material-UI theming

## üöÄ Workflow Process

1. **Repair Completion**: Work is finished and repair status is set to 'quality_control'

2. **QC Queue**: Main QC page displays all repairs pending review

3. **QC Review**: Staff clicks "Start QC Review" to open detailed review page

4. **Documentation**: 
   - Review repair summary and completed work
   - Take "after" photos for liability protection
   - Rate quality and note any issues

5. **Decision**: 
   - **APPROVE**: Sets status to 'ready_for_pickup' + notifies customer
   - **REJECT**: Sets status to 'ready_for_work' + adds notes for production team

6. **Completion**: QC data is saved to repair record with full audit trail

## üîí Data Security & Validation

- Photo file type validation (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- File size limits (10MB max)
- Secure S3 upload with error handling
- Form data sanitization
- API error handling with user feedback

## üé® User Experience

- Intuitive card-based layout for repair queue
- Clear visual indicators for priority and status  
- Step-by-step QC process with progress indicators
- Responsive design works on tablets/mobile
- Consistent with existing dashboard theme

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

1. **Photo Upload Testing**:
   - Test various image formats and sizes
   - Verify S3 upload functionality
   - Test drag-and-drop vs file picker

2. **Workflow Testing**:
   - Approve repair and verify status change
   - Reject repair and verify return to work queue
   - Test notes and quality rating persistence

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Verify QC data appears in repair history
   - Test with repairs context provider
   - Verify API error handling

## üìã Future Enhancements

- Email notifications for customers when approved
- QC metrics dashboard for management
- Photo comparison (before/after)
- Quality control checklists by repair type
- Integration with customer portal for photo sharing
