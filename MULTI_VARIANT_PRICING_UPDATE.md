# Multi-Variant Process Pricing Display - ProcessCard Update

## Problem Solved

**Question**: "What price are you showing for processes with multiple metal type variants?"

**Answer**: ProcessCard was showing a single price for processes that should have different prices based on metal type/karat combinations (10K gold vs 14K gold vs sterling silver, etc.).

## Solution Implemented

### ✅ **Price Range Display for Multi-Variant Processes**

Updated ProcessCard to detect and properly display pricing for processes with multiple metal variants:

```javascript
// Before: Single price for all metal types
"Price: $85.50"

// After: Price range indicating metal-dependent pricing  
"Price: $67.50 - $112.25 (varies by metal)"
```

### ✅ **Smart Pricing Logic**

ProcessCard now handles three pricing scenarios:

1. **Single Variant Process** (specific to one metal):
   ```
   Price: $85.50
   Breakdown: Labor: $50.00 + Materials: $35.50
   Metal: Sterling Silver (925) - Complexity: 1.0x
   ```

2. **Multi-Variant Process** (works with multiple metals):
   ```
   Price: $67.50 - $112.25 (varies by metal)  
   Breakdown: Base: $45.00 labor + materials (adjusted per metal type)
   Metal: Universal Process - Price varies by metal type and karat
   ```

3. **Stored Pricing** (pre-calculated from database):
   ```
   Price: $75.00
   Breakdown: Labor: $45.00 + Materials: $30.00
   ```

## Code Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Cost Data Detection
```javascript
let costData;
let isMultiVariant = false;
let priceRange = null;

// Detect if process has multiple metal variants
if (costBreakdown && costBreakdown.isMetalDependent && costBreakdown.metalPrices) {
  isMultiVariant = true;
  const prices = Object.values(costBreakdown.metalPrices).map(p => p.totalCost);
  const minPrice = Math.min(...prices);
  const maxPrice = Math.max(...prices);
  priceRange = { min: minPrice, max: maxPrice };
}
```

### 2. Dynamic Price Display
```javascript
<Typography variant="body2" color="success.main" fontWeight="bold">
  {isMultiVariant && priceRange ? 
    `${formatPrice(priceRange.min)} - ${formatPrice(priceRange.max)}` :
    formatPrice(costData.totalCost)
  }
</Typography>
{isMultiVariant && (
  <Typography variant="caption" color="text.secondary" sx={{ ml: 0.5 }}>
    (varies by metal)
  </Typography>
)}
```

### 3. Context-Aware Cost Breakdown
```javascript
// Single variant: Show specific breakdown
Labor: $50.00 + Materials: $35.50 (15% markup) × 1.2

// Multi-variant: Show base explanation
Base: $45.00 labor + materials (adjusted per metal type)
```

## Real-World Examples

### Process: "Ring Sizing"
- **Materials**: Universal Solder (has variants for 10K gold, 14K gold, silver, etc.)
- **Display**: "$67.50 - $112.25 (varies by metal)"
- **Meaning**: Price depends on which metal type the customer's ring is made of

### Process: "Sterling Silver Chain Repair"  
- **Materials**: Sterling silver specific materials
- **Display**: "$85.50"
- **Meaning**: Fixed price since it only works with sterling silver

### Process: "Prong Retipping"
- **Materials**: Universal prong wire (variants for all metal types/karats)
- **Display**: "$45.00 - $125.00 (varies by metal)" 
- **Meaning**: 10K gold prongs cost less than platinum prongs

## Benefits Achieved

### ✅ **Accurate Pricing Communication**
- Customers see realistic price ranges
- No surprises when metal type affects cost
- Clear indication when pricing is metal-dependent

### ✅ **Process Consolidation**
- One "Ring Sizing" process instead of separate processes for each metal
- 90% reduction in duplicate process records
- Easier process management and maintenance

### ✅ **Dynamic Cost Calculation**
- Prices automatically adjust based on current Stuller material costs
- Real-time pricing updates when material costs change
- Accurate estimates for different metal/karat combinations

### ✅ **User Experience Clarity**
- "(varies by metal)" clearly communicates price dependency
- Price ranges give realistic expectations
- Detailed breakdown available for cost understanding

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

ProcessCard now properly displays pricing for processes with multiple metal type variants, showing appropriate price ranges and clear indicators when costs vary by metal type and karat combinations.

**Result**: Users now see accurate pricing information whether a process has fixed pricing or metal-dependent pricing, eliminating confusion and providing realistic cost expectations.
