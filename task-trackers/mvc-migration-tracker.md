## ✅ COMPLETED MIGRATIONS (Using MVC Pattern)
Core Entity Management
✅ /api/tasks - COMPLETE MVC (Model, Service, Controller, Routes)

✅ Main routes: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
✅ Individual routes: /api/tasks/[id] (GET, PUT, DELETE)
✅ Statistics: /api/tasks/statistics (✅ Uses TasksController.getStatistics)
✅ Bulk operations: /api/tasks/bulk-update-pricing (✅ Now uses TasksController.bulkUpdatePricing)
✅ Process-based: /api/tasks/process-based (✅ Now uses TasksController.createProcessBasedTask)
✅ /api/materials - Complete MVC (Model, Service, Controller, Routes)

✅ Main routes: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
✅ Bulk operations: /api/materials/bulk-update-pricing
✅ /api/processes - Complete MVC (Model, Service, Controller, Routes)

✅ Main routes: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
✅ Find by materials: /api/processes/find-by-materials
✅ Bulk operations: /api/processes/bulk-update-pricing
✅ /api/repairs - Complete MVC (Model, Service, Controller, Routes)

✅ Main routes: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
✅ Individual routes: /api/repairs/[repairID]
✅ Quality control: /api/repairs/quality-control
✅ Move operations: /api/repairs/move
✅ Parts management: /api/repairs/parts
✅ /api/users - Complete MVC (Model, Service, Controller, Routes)

✅ Main routes: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
❌ PENDING MIGRATIONS (Non-MVC Routes)
High Priority - Core Functionality
❌ /api/repair-tasks - CRITICAL (Has CRUD route similar to tasks)
📁 Current: Monolithic routes + CRUD route
🎯 Target: Convert to full MVC like tasks
📋 Contains: /crud, /statistics, /search, /filters, /[sku]
Medium Priority - Business Logic
❌ /api/custom-tickets - Uses service layer but not MVC

📁 Current: Service-based monolithic routes
🎯 Target: Convert to MVC pattern
📋 Contains: Main route, [ticketId], /summary, Shopify integrations
❌ /api/contact - Basic functionality

📁 Current: Empty main route
🎯 Target: Implement MVC if needed
📋 Contains: /analytics, /bulk
Low Priority - Specialized/External
❌ /api/stuller - External API integration

📁 Current: Specialized integration routes
🎯 Target: Consider MVC if business logic grows
📋 Contains: /item, /update-prices
❌ /api/admin - Administrative functions

📁 Current: Monolithic admin routes
🎯 Target: Consider MVC for complex admin operations
📋 Contains: /settings (multiple), /initialize-processes-materials
❌ /api/repair-materials & /api/repair-processes - Public APIs

📁 Current: Simple public routes
🎯 Target: Low priority, assess if MVC needed
❌ /api/auth - Authentication (auth.js file)

📁 Current: Authentication utilities
🎯 Target: Likely doesn't need MVC pattern
🗂️ DEPRECATED/CLEANUP
Ready for Deletion
✅ /api/tasks/crud/route.js - DELETED ✅
✅ Fully replaced by MVC implementation
✅ All references updated in application
Assessment Needed
❓ /api/repair-tasks/crud/route.js - Similar to tasks CRUD
🔍 Needs analysis for migration to MVC
📊 MIGRATION STATISTICS
✅ Completed MVC: 5 entities (tasks, materials, processes, repairs, users)
❌ Pending MVC: 6-8 entities (repair-tasks, custom-tickets, contact, etc.)
🎯 Next Priority: repair-tasks (highest impact, similar to tasks)
📈 Progress: ~38% complete (5/13 major entities)
🎯 RECOMMENDED MIGRATION ORDER
🔥 IMMEDIATE: /api/repair-tasks - Critical business functionality
⚡ HIGH: /api/custom-tickets - Core business logic
📋 MEDIUM: /api/contact - If actively used
🔧 LOW: /api/admin routes - Administrative functions
🔌 ASSESS: /api/stuller - External integrations
📄 CLEANUP: Remove deprecated CRUD routes
