# Task Builder API Fix Summary

## 🔍 **Issue Identified**
The Process-Based Task Builder was failing to fetch processes and materials in production with 404 errors:
- ❌ `GET /api/repair-processes` → 404 Not Found
- ❌ `GET /api/repair-materials` → 404 Not Found

## 🔧 **Root Cause**
The task builder was using incorrect API endpoints. The actual API routes are:
- ✅ `/api/processes` (not `/api/repair-processes`)
- ✅ `/api/materials` (not `/api/repair-materials`)

## 🚀 **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Corrected API Endpoints**
Updated the fetch URLs in `loadInitialData()`:
```javascript
// Before (incorrect)
fetch('/api/repair-processes')
fetch('/api/repair-materials') 

// After (correct)
fetch('/api/processes')
fetch('/api/materials')
```

### 2. **Enhanced Authentication**
Added proper authentication headers to ensure API calls work in production:
```javascript
const fetchOptions = {
  method: 'GET',
  credentials: 'include',
  headers: {
    'Accept': 'application/json',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
};
```

### 3. **Improved Error Handling & Debugging**
- Added comprehensive error logging for failed API calls
- Added error state tracking for processes, materials, and settings
- Enhanced console logging to debug production issues
- Better error messages with status codes and response details

### 4. **User Experience Improvements**
- Added warning alerts when processes or materials fail to load
- Provided clear explanations of what functionality is affected
- Added retry button to allow users to attempt reloading data
- Graceful degradation - admin settings still work even if processes/materials fail

### 5. **Response Data Handling**
Verified and ensured correct parsing of API responses:
- Processes API returns: `{ success: true, processes: [...] }`
- Materials API returns: `{ success: true, materials: [...] }`
- Settings API returns: `{ pricing: {...}, business: {...}, ... }`

## 📋 **Verification Steps**

The fixed task builder now:
1. ✅ Uses correct API endpoints (`/api/processes`, `/api/materials`)
2. ✅ Includes proper authentication credentials
3. ✅ Handles errors gracefully with user feedback
4. ✅ Provides retry functionality for failed requests
5. ✅ Logs detailed debugging information
6. ✅ Maintains functionality even with partial data loading failures

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

After deployment, the Process-Based Task Builder should:
- Successfully load processes for selection in the process dropdown
- Successfully load materials for the materials section
- Display comprehensive pricing calculations
- Show helpful error messages if any API calls fail
- Allow users to retry failed data loads

The production environment should now match the development environment functionality.

## 🔍 **Additional Notes**

- Admin settings were already loading correctly, confirming authentication works
- The repairs data loads fine (180+ repairs), confirming the session is valid
- The issue was specifically with the incorrect API endpoint paths
- All error handling is non-blocking - users can still create tasks with available data
