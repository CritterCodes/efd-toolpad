# Security Implementation for Sensitive Admin Data

This implementation adds robust encryption and security measures for sensitive admin data including integration credentials, security codes, and other confidential information.

## üîê Features

### Encryption
- **AES-256-GCM encryption** for sensitive data (passwords, API keys, tokens)
- **Secure key derivation** from environment variables
- **Base64 encoding** for database storage
- **Authentication tags** for data integrity verification

### Security Codes
- **One-way hashing** using scrypt for security PINs
- **Salt-based hashing** prevents rainbow table attacks
- **Automatic expiration** with configurable timeouts
- **Failed attempt logging** for security monitoring

### Audit Trail
- **Comprehensive logging** of all sensitive data operations
- **IP address and user agent tracking** for forensics
- **Success/failure tracking** with detailed error reasons
- **Structured audit data** for security analysis

## üöÄ Setup

### 1. Environment Variables

Add to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Generate a secure 32-byte key:
# node -e "console.log('ENCRYPTION_KEY=' + require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-base64-encoded-32-byte-key-here
```

### 2. Database Migration

Run the migration script to encrypt existing data:

```bash
node scripts/migrate-encrypt-sensitive-data.js
```

### 3. Verify Implementation

1. **Admin Settings**: Test security PIN generation and verification
2. **Stuller Integration**: Verify encrypted password storage and decryption
3. **Audit Logs**: Check that all operations are being logged

## üîß API Changes

### Stuller Settings (`/api/admin/settings/stuller`)
- **Passwords** are now encrypted before storage
- **Masked display** shows `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢` instead of actual passwords
- **Automatic decryption** when making API calls
- **Enhanced audit logging** with IP tracking

### Security Codes (`/api/admin/settings/verify-code`)
- **Hashed storage** instead of plaintext
- **Verification function** compares hashes securely
- **Generation logging** with expiration tracking
- **Failed attempt tracking** for security monitoring

### Admin Settings (`/api/admin/settings`)
- **Hash verification** for security code validation
- **Audit trail** for all settings changes
- **Enhanced error handling** with security logging

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Key Management
- **Never commit** encryption keys to version control
- **Use environment variables** for key storage in production
- **Consider key rotation** policies for enhanced security
- **Backup encrypted data** with separate key storage

### Database Security
- **Separate audit collection** for security events
- **Indexed queries** for efficient audit log searching
- **Retention policies** for audit data management
- **Access controls** on sensitive collections

### Monitoring
- **Failed login attempts** are logged with IP addresses
- **Unusual access patterns** can be detected through audit logs
- **Encryption/decryption failures** are captured and logged
- **Security code generation** is tracked and auditable

## üìä Audit Log Structure

```javascript
{
  timestamp: Date,
  operation: String,     // 'stuller_settings_update', 'security_code_verification', etc.
  dataType: String,      // 'integration_credentials', 'admin_settings_access', etc.
  userEmail: String,     // User performing the operation
  ip: String,           // Client IP address
  userAgent: String,    // Client user agent
  success: Boolean,     // Operation success/failure
  reason: String,       // Failure reason (if applicable)
  details: Object       // Additional operation-specific data
}
```

## üß™ Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Test encryption functions
npm test utils/encryption.test.js

# Test API endpoints with encryption
npm test api/admin/settings.test.js
```

### Manual Testing
1. **Generate security PIN** and verify it works
2. **Save Stuller credentials** and test connection
3. **Check audit logs** for proper tracking
4. **Verify password masking** in admin interface

## üö® Security Considerations

### Data in Transit
- All API communications use HTTPS in production
- Authentication headers contain encrypted data
- Session tokens are properly secured

### Data at Rest
- Sensitive fields are encrypted in the database
- Security codes use one-way hashing
- Audit logs contain masked sensitive data

### Access Control
- Admin operations require authentication
- Security codes have expiration times
- Failed attempts are rate-limited and logged

## üîÑ Migration Notes

### Existing Data
- Run migration script before deploying encryption changes
- Backup database before running migration
- Test all admin functions after migration

### Backward Compatibility
- Code handles both encrypted and unencrypted data during transition
- Gradual migration prevents service interruption
- Audit trail tracks migration completion

## üìà Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
- **Key rotation** automation
- **Multi-factor authentication** for admin access
- **Advanced threat detection** through audit analysis
- **Compliance reporting** features

### Integration Options
- **Hardware security modules** (HSM) for key storage
- **External key management** services
- **SIEM integration** for security monitoring
- **Automated security scanning** and alerts

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Encryption Key Not Found**
```
Error: ENCRYPTION_KEY environment variable not set
Solution: Add ENCRYPTION_KEY to your .env.local file
```

**Decryption Failed**
```
Error: Failed to decrypt sensitive data
Solution: Verify ENCRYPTION_KEY matches the key used for encryption
```

**Security Code Invalid**
```
Error: Invalid or expired security code
Solution: Generate a new security PIN through the admin interface
```

**Audit Log Growing Large**
```
Issue: adminSettingsAudit collection consuming disk space
Solution: Implement audit log retention policy and archiving
```
