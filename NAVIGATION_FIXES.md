# Navigation Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. FAB (Floating Action Button) Route Fix
**Problem**: The main FAB "New Repair" button was pointing to `/dashboard/repairs/all?newRepair=true` which doesn't exist anymore.

**Solution**: Updated the route in `src/app/components/fab/component.js` to point to `/dashboard/repairs/new`

**File Changed**: 
- `src/app/components/fab/component.js` - Line 19: Updated onClick route

### 2. Enhanced Receiving Page Actions
**Improvement**: Added a prominent "Create New Repair" button to the receiving page's Quick Actions section.

**Changes Made**:
- Replaced the "Print" button with a "New Repair" button
- Made it a primary (contained) button to make it stand out
- Uses the correct route `/dashboard/repairs/new`
- Still maintains the "Move" functionality

**File Changed**: 
- `src/app/dashboard/repairs/receiving/page.js` - Lines 154-178: Updated Quick Actions section

## Navigation Flow Now:

### Ways to Create New Repairs:
1. **Main FAB** (available everywhere) → `/dashboard/repairs/new`
2. **Receiving Page Button** (Quick Actions) → `/dashboard/repairs/new` 
3. **Receiving Page FAB** (bottom right) → `/dashboard/repairs/new`
4. **Ready for Work FAB** (bottom right) → `/dashboard/repairs/new`

All routes now correctly point to the dedicated new repair page instead of the non-existent query parameter route.

## Verified:
✅ No compilation errors
✅ All routes point to correct `/dashboard/repairs/new` endpoint
✅ Multiple access points for creating new repairs
✅ Consistent user experience across all repair workflow pages
