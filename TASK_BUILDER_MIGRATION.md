# 🚀 Task Builder Migration: Basic → Process-Based

## 📋 Overview

This document outlines the migration from the basic task builder to the process-based task builder system. The goal is to standardize all task creation using the more robust process-based approach.

## 🎯 Why Migrate?

### **Problems with Basic Task Builder:**
- Manual pricing prone to errors
- No process standardization
- Limited pricing flexibility
- Difficult to maintain consistency
- No automatic pricing updates

### **Benefits of Process-Based Builder:**
- ✅ Accurate, automated pricing calculations
- ✅ Process standardization and reusability  
- ✅ Metal-context-aware pricing
- ✅ Material cost integration
- ✅ Business rule compliance
- ✅ Easier maintenance and updates

## 📊 Migration Status

### **Phase 1: Navigation Updates** ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [x] Updated main "Create Task" button to redirect to process-based builder
- [x] Added deprecation notice to basic task builder
- [x] Updated FAB (floating action button) to go directly to process-based
- [x] Marked basic builder as "Deprecated" in dropdown menu
- [x] Updated process-based builder to be the primary "Task Builder"

### **Phase 2: Data Migration** 🔄 **Ready to Execute**
- [x] Created migration script: `scripts/migrate-basic-to-process-simple.js`
- [ ] Execute migration on existing basic tasks
- [ ] Verify migrated data integrity
- [ ] Test migrated tasks in repair workflows

### **Phase 3: Cleanup** ⏳ **Pending**
- [ ] Remove basic task builder files
- [ ] Clean up unused API routes
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Remove deprecated navigation options

## 🛠️ Migration Process

### **Step 1: Run Migration Script**

The migration script will:
1. Identify all basic tasks (those without processes)
2. Create a generic repair process for mapping
3. Convert each basic task to process-based structure
4. Preserve original pricing data for reference

```bash
# Run the migration
cd /path/to/efd-react
node scripts/migrate-basic-to-process-simple.js
```

### **Step 2: Verify Migration**

After migration, check that:
- All tasks now have `processes` array
- Original pricing preserved in `originalBasicTask` field
- New process-based pricing calculated
- Tasks display correctly in the admin interface

### **Step 3: Test Workflows**

Ensure migrated tasks work correctly in:
- Task selection during repair creation
- Pricing calculations
- Process-based workflows
- Repair ticket generation

## 📝 Migration Script Details

### **What the Script Does:**
1. **Finds Basic Tasks**: Identifies tasks without processes
2. **Creates Generic Process**: Creates "Generic Repair (Migrated)" process
3. **Converts Structure**: Transforms basic tasks to process-based format
4. **Preserves Data**: Keeps original pricing in `originalBasicTask` field
5. **Updates Pricing**: Applies process-based pricing structure

### **Example Migration:**

**Before (Basic Task):**
```javascript
{
  _id: "task123",
  title: "Ring Sizing Down",
  category: "sizing",
  basePrice: 75,
  laborHours: 1.5,
  description: "Size ring down by 1-2 sizes"
}
```

**After (Process-Based):**
```javascript
{
  _id: "task123",
  title: "Ring Sizing Down", 
  category: "sizing",
  processes: [
    {
      processId: "generic-repair-migrated",
      quantity: 1
    }
  ],
  materials: [],
  originalBasicTask: {
    basePrice: 75,
    laborHours: 1.5,
    migratedAt: "2025-08-25T..."
  },
  pricing: {
    totalLaborHours: 1.0,
    totalProcessCost: 75,
    baseCost: 75,
    retailPrice: 150,
    calculatedAt: "2025-08-25T..."
  },
  migratedFromBasic: true
}
```

## 🔄 Current User Experience

### **For Task Creation:**
1. **Main Button**: "Create Process-Based Task" (primary CTA)
2. **FAB Button**: Goes directly to process-based builder
3. **Dropdown Menu**: Process-based first, basic marked as deprecated
4. **Empty State**: Directs to process-based builder

### **For Basic Builder Access:**
- Still accessible via dropdown menu (with deprecation warning)
- Shows clear migration notice and recommendation
- Provides easy switch to process-based builder

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Execute Migration**: Run the migration script on production data
2. **Verify Results**: Test migrated tasks thoroughly  
3. **Monitor Usage**: Track if users still access basic builder
4. **Complete Cleanup**: Remove basic builder once confirmed unused
5. **Update Training**: Train staff on process-based task creation

---

## 🚨 Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback steps:
1. All original data preserved in `originalBasicTask` field
2. Can restore basic task structure if needed
3. Navigation changes are easily reversible
4. Migration script can be run in reverse if necessary

## 💡 Benefits Realized

After migration completion:
- ✅ **Consistency**: All tasks use same creation method
- ✅ **Accuracy**: Process-based pricing eliminates manual errors  
- ✅ **Scalability**: Easier to add new processes and materials
- ✅ **Maintenance**: Single task builder to maintain
- ✅ **Training**: Staff only needs to learn one system
- ✅ **Future-Ready**: Ready for universal metal context integration

---

**Status**: Navigation updates complete, ready to execute data migration
**Next Action**: Run migration script and verify results
