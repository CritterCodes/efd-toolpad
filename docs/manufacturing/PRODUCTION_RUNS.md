# Production Runs — artisan-initiated production (no shop order required)

**Status:** architecture draft (2026-07-23) — poke holes before building.
**Owner scenario:** an artisan has a sketch, wants a limited run of 10: request CAD → get it back →
build variants → cast X of each variant → bench work (self or someone else) → sellable pieces.

## 0. First axiom — SOLO-FIRST (owner, 2026-07-23)

**The pipeline must be fully usable without outsourcing anything.** If one person does their own
CAD, casting, and bench work, the work orders are *bookkeeping* — and that bookkeeping is the
point:

- **WOs are the earnings ledger.** Labor credited at QC → `laborLogs` → payroll, *even when paid
  to yourself*. The owner runs EFD this way today: the WO system gates his own draws so he never
  withdraws more than he's "earned." Artisans get the same guarantee for free.
- **WOs default PRIVATE.** A run's WOs spawn **pre-assigned to the creator** — mechanically
  invisible to everyone else's bench (the queue only shows unclaimed lane work + your own). No
  flag needed for the solo case; it falls out of assignment.
- **Outsourcing = releasing.** Unclaim (or spawn unassigned) → the WO enters the lane queue for
  any type-matched artisan to claim; or direct-assign a specific artisan. Three modes, one field:
  `assignedToUserID` (self | null/queue | someone).

## 1. What already exists (the run rides on it)

| Stage | Machinery | State |
|---|---|---|
| Order-less piece minting | `beginManualPieceProduction` — edition-checked, transactional, assigns edition # | ✅ engine (admin-only route) |
| Edition cap ("only 10") | edition counters; 11th piece refused | ✅ |
| WOs per discipline + lane claiming + QC + labor at QC | full bench machinery incl. `gem_cutting` lane | ✅ |
| CAD WO flow (STL→QC→approve, flat fee) | built — but only customs spawns it | ✅ flow, ❌ on-ramp |
| Design CAD statuses (`cad_requested/…/cad_qc`) | enum exists, nothing drives it | ❌ on-ramp |
| Casting | piece status + inline cost on customs; **no casting lane/board/service** | ⚠ weakest link |
| Shipping between artisans | nothing | ❌ |
| Artisan access to any of this | pieces/WO creation is admin-only | ❌ |

## 2. The Run model

```
run: {
  runId, designID, createdBy (artisan), status: planned|cad|casting|bench|qc|done|cancelled,
  items: [{ variantId, qty }],          // "4× variant A, 6× variant B"
  pieceIDs: [],                          // minted via beginManualPieceProduction (edition-checked)
  solo: true|false                       // default WO assignment = creator vs queue
}
```

Stages (each optional — skip what you don't need):
1. **Request CAD** (pre-variants): a `cad` WO on the DESIGN (sketch attached) — drives the existing
   `cad_requested → cad_in_progress → cad_qc` statuses; claimable or self-assigned. Approval lands
   STL/GLB on the design (same uploads as today).
2. **Build variants** (existing editor).
3. **Start the run**: mint `Σ qty` pieces transactionally (all-or-nothing against the edition cap),
   spawn the routing WOs per piece with the run's assignment mode; **casting batch** = one casting
   action covering the run's pieces (vendor order OR in-house — see open decisions).
4. **Bench/finish**: existing WO flow; labor credits at QC to whoever did it.
5. **Done** → pieces `available` (RTS) → list/attach to a drop.

## 3. Solo-mode wrinkles (design around these)

- **Self-QC:** CAD approval currently REQUIRES a peer (can't approve your own work). Solo runs
  need a policy: (a) admin QCs, (b) solo runs skip peer review with an explicit "self-certified"
  stamp on the log, or (c) QC fee simply isn't credited when self-approved. Owner call.
- **Piece labor QC:** move-to-QC → someone completes QC. Same question, lighter stakes (the
  pendingQc release just needs a clicker — self-complete with an audit stamp is probably fine).
- **Gem coupling:** run minting must also claim linked gem editions (same transaction) — this is
  the same guard as gemstone Phase 3; build once, both use it.

## 4. Open decisions
1. **Casting: a WO lane or a vendor order?** In-house casters want a `casting` discipline WO
   (claim/QC/labor like any lane). Outsourced casting is a purchase (vendor, invoice →
   businessExpenses, received-date) — probably BOTH, chosen per run.
   **The casting board is ownership-scoped (owner, 2026-07-23)** — same pattern as My Designs/
   My Drops/My Bench: ONE board, API-scoped. An artisan sees THEIR runs' casting queue —
   `needs_ordering → ordered (vendor, est) → received` per batch/piece — "what castings they have
   and haven't ordered"; EFD/staff see everything. Solo self-casting = an in-house `casting` WO
   (no vendor entry). This finally defines the placeholder Production→Casting board.
   **Payment timing — DECIDED (owner, 2026-07-23): (b) pay at RECEIPT.** When an artisan orders a
   casting through EFD's casting-house account, the invoice to the artisan fires when the casting
   is RECEIVED (actual vendor cost known — no estimating at order time), and the casting is
   **gated from shipping to them until paid**. EFD floats the vendor cost only for the
   order→receipt window; the deliverable gate keeps the nothing-is-fronted guarantee where it
   matters (nothing leaves EFD's hands unpaid).
2. **Shipping legs:** minimum viable = a `shipments` record per handoff `{ from, to, carrier,
   tracking, pieceIDs, status }` + "piece is physically at X". How much more?
3. **Materials for runs:** casting metal cost lands on piece COGS how (per-piece split of the
   vendor invoice, like customs' inline recorder)?
4. ~~Who pays whom~~ **DECIDED (owner, 2026-07-23) — the ledger split + PAY-AT-COMPLETION.**
   Every labor log gains a `payer` scope; the rule is mechanical (laborer == the piece's owning
   artisan → `self`, else → `efd`):
   - **`efd` (outsourced run work):** the laborer is credited at QC and paid by EFD payroll as
     normal — but **the owning artisan is billed AT COMPLETION, not at sale. NOTHING IS FRONTED**
     (owner, verbatim intent): no product, digital or physical, is released to the artisan on
     credit. WO fulfilled → invoice the artisan (the Stripe customs-invoice rail generalizes to
     artisan billing) → **the deliverable is gated on payment** — CAD files don't unlock, castings
     don't ship, finished pieces don't hand off until the bill is paid. "They make a work order
     and it is fulfilled; they are liable for paying that bill." EFD's exposure is bounded by the
     release gate, and consignment payouts stay clean (pure gross − EFD cut; no labor clawbacks).
   - **`self`:** solo work on your OWN piece. Never payroll-payable and never billed (you don't
     invoice yourself) — accrues into the piece's COGS and my-work as earned-but-unrealized value,
     realized at sale through the consignment payout.
   - The owner himself is the degenerate case where self ≈ efd (he IS EFD), which is why his
     pay-himself-via-WOs flow already works without the field.
   - `salePayouts.estimatedLaborHoldback`/`actualLaborDeduction` remain what they are today (the
     repair/sales context) — they are NOT used for run labor; runs settle at completion.

## 4b. Settlement direction — Stripe Connect (owner, 2026-07-23)

**Stripe Connect is the designated settlement layer** — adopt when consignment volume warrants,
but **build the money model Connect-compatible from day one**:
- Every ledger row that pays a person (`laborLogs`, `salePayouts`, artisan invoices) carries a
  **per-artisan payee identity** (`payeeUserID` today; a `stripeAccountId` alongside it when
  Connect onboards) — so flipping to Connect is a settlement swap, not a re-architecture.
- Target flows: consignment sales = destination charge with EFD's cut as the application fee
  (automates salePayouts→payroll and gets 1099s handled); laborer payouts = optional transfers
  at QC-release; **artisan billing at WO completion stays plain Stripe invoices** (the customs
  rail generalized) — Connect not required there.
- `laborLogs`/`salePayouts` remain the SOURCE OF TRUTH; Connect only moves the money. Release
  gates (pay-at-completion, casting-at-receipt) are enforced by the pipeline, never assumed of
  Stripe.

## 5. Sequencing vs gemstone Phase 3
Both need the same core: **hardened non-order production entry + claim-time gem coupling**.
Suggested order: (1) run minting + gem-edition claim in one transactional service (serves both),
(2) Request-CAD on designs, (3) casting decision + batch, (4) shipping legs, (5) artisan-facing
run UI. Related: `GEMSTONE_DESIGNS_AND_INVENTORY.md`, `ARTISAN_DROPS_AND_COLLABORATION.md`.
